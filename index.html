								<h2 class="major">Academic Projects</h2>
								<ul>
									<h3>Cloud Computing</h3>
									<li>Designed a web application using Python and Flask Framework that allows users to fetch 10000+ data from Azure Database using SQL queries and view earthquake data from the last 30 days, search for earthquakes within a specific magnitude range, locate earthquakes within their current radius.</li>
									<li>Optimized the application's performance by implementing caching using Azure Redis, resulting in a 50% reduction in response time (from 8 seconds to 4 seconds) and deployment of the application onto the browser through Azure app services.</li> 
									<li>Implemented data visualization techniques using D3.js to display search results in a graphical format (Bar or Pie chart, Scatter plot) within the browser.</li>
								</ul>
								<ul>
									<h3>Machine learning: Gender Prediction using Body Measurements </h3>
									<li>Created a machine learning model to predict the gender of an individual considering various physical measurements such as Height, Weight and Age. </li>
									<li>Performed data cleaning and preprocessing on the raw dataset utilizing Python's built-in string manipulation and data handling functions. </li> 
									<li>Developed a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model from scratch, trained the model and achieved an accuracy of 75% on a test set of 1,000 samples. </li>
								</ul>
								<ul>
									<h3>Tableau Dashboard Project: COVID-19 Pandemic </h3>
									<li>Extracted and cleaned COVID-19 data from a MySQL database containing over 300k+ rows using Python.</li>
									<li>Created Excel files containing the cleaned data for use in Tableau.</li> 
									<li>Developed a Tableau dashboard with visualizations of total deaths, percent population infected per country, total deaths by continent, and percent population infected.</li> 
									<li><a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jayesh.parsnani/viz/CovidDashboard_16810054254330/Dashboard1?publish=yes">Dashboard<a/></li> 								
								</ul>
								<ul>
									<h3>Diet Recommendation System for Diabetic Patients</h3>
									<li>Conceptualized personalized diet and exercise schedule by using the AI algorithms like K-means and Decision tree classifier model in the application.</li>
									<li>Developed a K-means algorithm to generate diet plans based on an individual’s health information which has 93% accuracy rate and delivered the plans in 30 seconds, which is faster than the previous algorithm BIRCH, which took approximately 6 minutes to do the same task.</li> 
									<li>Designed Decision Tree Classifier algorithm for generating Exercise-Plan as per the individual health details which achieved an accuracy rate of 87.9% and runtime of 40 seconds which was faster and outperformed other algorithms that were tested on rapid miner tool.</li>
									<li>Published <a href = "https://www.ijera.com/special_issue/ICAITR-2101/3, 10-15.pdf"> research paper</a> in International Journal of Engineering Research and Applications    </li>

								<ul>
									<h3>Car Parking System </h3>
									<li>Orchestrated an entire process using IoT-based Raspberry Pi technology for users to park their vehicles efficiently and reducing parking time by 25%.</li>
									<li>Developed an automated license plate recognition system that processed 100+ images daily, using camera modules and cutting-edge image processing techniques which extract text and store it in a SQL database; reduced manual data entry time by 80% and increased processing speed by 50%. </li> 
									<li>Integrated a robust security feature using Twilio API which notifies users via text message in case their vehicle is relocated from the original parking location which is sensed by Ultrasonic sensor whether user car is parked or not.</li>
									<li>Project video: <a href = "assets/CarParkingSystem.mov">demo</a></li>
								</ul>
								<ul>
									<h3>Hotel Management System</h3>
									<li>Developed a web application for managing a hotel with 100+ rooms, allowing users to book various types of rooms, including Deluxe, Non-Deluxe, and conference rooms, based on their needs.</li>
									<li>Implemented an admin feature that allows the admin to lock or unlock rooms as needed, with access to user information for tracking bookings and offering discounts.</li>
									<li>Designed a loyalty program that provides discounts and special offers to loyal customers who frequently book rooms, helping to drive repeat business and customer satisfaction.</li>
